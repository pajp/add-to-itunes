A script for re-encoding mkv files into something that iTunes and Apple TV
likes. Suitable for calling from a Folder Action in order to automatically
encode and add new downloaded movies.
Requires HandBrakeCLI:
 http://handbrake.fr/downloads2.php
Requires growlnotify (probably works without it):
 http://growl.info/extras.php

To make this script run automatically when a new file is downloaded,
start Automator, select Folder Action, drag a "Run Shell Script" action
to the flow. Set the contents of the Shell Script to the path of this
file plus "$@" for all arguments, for example:
    /Users/rasmus/bin/process-download.sh "$@"
Change the "Pass input" dropdown to "as arguments" if it isn't set already.
The Folder Action activates when saved.

todo:
* do label_file_encoded without revealing the file in Finder (can interfere
  if you're working with Finder at the moment)
* check if the file already exists in iTunes library before adding it
